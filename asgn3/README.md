To build and run our assignment, please follow the following steps :
–cd asgn3
–make
–bin/parser test/test1.c (to execute the first test-case file test1.c)
–firefox test1.htm          (To run test1, similarly change test1 to the desired file you want to run)

About the current parser build:
1. We could not implement class (OOP) in our current parser build because it was giving a lot of reduce-reduce errors.
