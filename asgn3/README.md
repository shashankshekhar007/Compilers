To build and run our assignment, please follow the following steps :
1. cd asgn3               (If not already in asgn2, otherwise ignore this step.)
2. make
3. bin/parser test/test1.go             (To run test1, similarly change test1 to the desired file you want to run)
4. firefox test1.html

About the current parser build:
1. We could not implement class (OOP) in our current parser build because it was giving a lot of reduce-reduce errors.
